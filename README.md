# FOOD DELIVERY APP
# About this Website

This project is a responsive `Delivery Partner Web Application` built using `React`.
The app is designed specifically for `delivery drivers`, helping them `manage orders`, navigate to `customer locations`, `track earnings`, and `view notifications` in a clean and modern interface.

# Project Overview

The Food Delivery App allows users to:

 * View assigned delivery orders
 * Track order status (Accepted → Picked Up → On the Way → Delivered)
 * Navigate to pickup and drop locations
 * Check notifications for new orders and updates
 * View their driver profile, ID, ratings, and earnings
 * Switch their online/offline availability

# Technologies Used

* React JS
* React Router DOM
* Tailwind CSS 
* React Icons

 # Content

* This portal is created with `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript` and `React`.
* This is a `responsive website` which can be accessible in all devices.
* This delivery app contains four different insights like `Home`, `Orders`, `Notification` and `Profile`.
* In the `Home page`, we have placed a switch that replicates the driver status as `Online` or `Offline`.
* If the Driver status is `online`, the present delivery details will show along with the `today earnings`, `completed order`, `working hours` and `distance`.
* Also, in the `homepage` we have a support option with a `API assistant`.
* In `order page`, we have three insights like `Active`, `Completed` and `Cancelled`.
* In the `active`, we can see the `present delivery status` along with the navigation `address` and in the `completed section` we can see the `orders completed` along with the `payment details` and in the `order cancelled` we can see the `cancelled details`.
* In the `notification page`, we can see the `order details`, `completed order payment details` and `cancelled order details` along with the `milestone reached` and the `system update`.
* In the `profile section`, we can see the `driver's rating`, their `eraning overview`, `vehicle details`, `performance status` and `settings`. Under the `settings`, we can change the features to `dark mode` and also we can `increase and decrease the brightness`. Also, we can `logout` and `login` this features.
